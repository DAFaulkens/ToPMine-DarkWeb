looks like its just major delays a little over hours ago with nothing in the fog.
were running towards days on an attempted deposit to fog no action yet its complete via the chain had confirmations hrs ago no reply from support hrs has anyone seen worse hope fogs no qu ed now.
its all ok now very slownearely days for the deposite to show normal withdraw complete.
give read many reports of slow deposits or slow withdrawals from btc fog over the past couple of months had a withdrawal myself that showed as complete on fog but no trace on blockchain which completed perfectly if a little later than i had hoped what i havent seen is someone complaining that their transaction never completed personally i trust bitcoin fog had a few blips where i doubted i must admit but dont use them if theres any kind of urgency with your transaction is my advice peace.

is this the same vendor as thegratefuldeadfamily was on agora got some white on white fluff practically laid on cardboard paper from those guys ive yet to try.
this whole thing with abraham other markets going down just plain sucks and throws a huge monkey wrench into all pending transactions i feel much empathy for both the buyers who get caught up in it as well as the vendors who like greatfullydeadicated will not only stand to lose a huge amount of funds but also are put on the spot with scenarios such as with reputations compromise its such a damned shame.

hey everybody new to this community but looking forward to sticking around a while i was wondering if anyone had any estimation as to when cm will be back in business also are they current checking their pms on here definitely my favorite vendor of all time give been using them since sr and am just now in need of their services again i kind of lost touch with them and plan on placing an order in mid january i just done want to get coins and then not be able to track them down as im taking a tolerance break until that time ill be so ready for that gorgeous oz ive only ordered their premium line but am going to go for their exquisite and treat myself a little their premium selections were the best buds give ever had give spent the last two years in a legal zone and they couldnt touch what i got from cm well look forward to your replies thanks all.
we know cult has got some gamesome stuff but you may want to check out some of our selection as well.
cm are on some market if in not wrong id love to try them out the reviews have been really good.
they have a thread in the non active vendors area here is a direct link to the thread they have their contact info in it.
hi can you share cults contact if you dont mind thanks.
everything alright with the cult their page has gone and had no reply from emails for a couple of days.
announcement will clear up some of your questions guys.
pretty sure forbidden words were put as to stop spammers who kept hitting up all the forums trying to sell btc and stuff like that your response must have included some of those words shame that it has to be like that but its better than a forum full of spam.
this guy is right it also blocks people from advertising products such as blow n smak.
hi im stevemba im a senior psychiatrist and psychoanalyst and an old connoisseur of psychedelics yesterday and today i tried to post replies in conformity of a scientific point of view and also based on personal experiences my replieswere automatically stopped because contained forbidden words im quite astonished what kind of place is majestic garden where there are people which think in terms of forbidden words this is the language of big brother of george orwell id like to know what the community think about best regardsstevemba.
there are hundreds of post made each day but you have a problem what words may i ask are you trying to use.
hi enigmaticsmiles the problem is is this forum a free place where people exchange each other opinions and advices or is there inside of it a lobby of few people especially vendors who are more equal than others as in animal farm by orwell and decide what is allowed or forbidden to say i think that we all must reflect on this point because freedom of expression is the base of a democratic mind especially in such a community made by people i hope that dont tolerate impositions governments already do this way best regardsstevemba.
hi mr serioustripping i havent at all tried to post spam or things like that only my scientific opinions especially in a case of a man who was looking for help about the effects of a lsd trip which turned bad if one is not reasonable free tospeak what kind of forum is this best regardsstevemba.
tbh i dont see the btc ads stopping.
stevemba senior psychiatrist and psychoanalystits free to what the avengers allow you dont like it dont let the gate hit your back side.
i thank you very much hypoteticalbananas first for your politeness which is quite rare as i see for the future ill followyour devices in writing my opinions because its more important to share experiences than spending time disputing best regardsstevemba.

stevemba there is no censorship going on its just that spammers and scammers on tmg have been relentless terrorizing the forum so the admins attempted to block their most frequently used words the forum would be unreadable otherwise just use synonyms or if thats not possible insert a space in the word.
chill chillof course its free speech etc there is a general thread outlining rules of the forum on what is forbidden posting mostly advertising certain substances as mentioned above for example if you are a psychiatrist information is always wanted here on psychiatric psychological and psychoanalytical issues but advertising harm sales is against the forum rules intelligent discussion and advice is what makes tmg interestingand on censorship there is a lot of spamming and i have no doubt the admins are much quicker than i am on spotting a scammer.
aw i was really hoping this guy wasnt just a spammer.
lookin for the king of mama stealthbomber from agora someone please point me in the right direction.
hes on dhl actually last seen hours ago.
check point had a bust in one of his pill pressing units so people think its not safe to order from him anymore atleast for a while ive used cp long ago though how is is stealth these days for g orders.
cp himself posted on the dhl forums i believe.
quote from bonobo on january pmcheck point had a bust in one of his pill pressing units so people think its not safe to order from him anymore atleast for a while ive used cp long ago though how is is stealth these days for g orders is there any elegant prove to this as in le bust at one of the pressing hubs.
even i came across a post that his lab was busted makes me a bit suspicious why would he post that in the first place and that also means there are leaks in his organization and the cops are investigating him.
whatever happened to that bungee dude.
find him on dhl give been using him lots.
quote from cyclonewatson on january amfind him on dhl give been using him lotswhats the average turn around i made my first order with him a while ago to have a variety other than cp i keep reading things about how hes on and off with shipping times.
how is the stealth of stealthbomber and his product thanks ahead.
its nothing to write home about but got the job done when i ordered from him a while back i wouldnt have issue ordering again from him.
i will be purchasing an item using multisignature escrow however my primary bitin wallet was not created using electrum and therefore i can not use the public key option on an address that was created with electric my question is is it possible to generate a public key from a bitcoin address that was not created using electrum or bitcoin it any help will be appreciated i am trying to avoid having to transfer funds out of my primary wallet to my secondary wallet and then to the escrow service so that i dont lose bitcoin through network fees.
i was looking to place an order yesterday but i was not able to connect to the site more than hours later i still can not connect to the site hoping they didnt get sucked does anyone know what happened or if they moved to a new address.
another one bites the dust really sorry to anyone who lost anything here.

they moved out west.
they got straight marked for not remain west india shoulda known better honestly.
really loved this market hope its a routine update server migration and not some exit scam anybody knows something more days down without any news doesnt look good.
quote from tang on january amquote from seedofchaos on january amthey got straight murked for not remain west india shoulda known better honestly my wire reference senses are tingling i really should get around to watching that show one of these days.
deepdotweb is saying its probably gone just some downtime.
is this market gone or not thanks.
this sucking place is ride eic was actually doing great growth wise they were getting at least half of their orders via msig and then they scammed it couldnt have been a very lucrative scam tho because while they were still growing they were huge they also had lots of msig if they waited a year and scammed theyd be millionaires but the market is still online and functions except for withdrawals of course so maybe in wrong about scammer but in consider them dead i cant see recovery from this charade even if they come back gamesome market tho proved once again that msig works but they got me for a few grand in the central crow side that makes abpprox the th market whos stolen my central escrow over past few years quote from themajesticgarden on february pmis this market gone or not thanks.
the true story of eic is that it went down in mid late december the tech team worked hard to sort out whatever issues and bring it back online but in between it going down and coming back up weeks the admin was busted died put in a coma evolved into a higher being passed out and never logged back in you see the teach side and the managerial side were geographical separate when the tech guys realized the boss wasnt coming back they figured well thats the keys gone so theres no money to be made so why would we run an illegal market as a non profit charity so they fucked and offed eic ran until the prepaid hosting experienced and thats as they say is that but thats all just a theory a game theory.
that sucks.

does it really matter if we find this guy or not i feel like this is a pointless search lol.
a new market has popped up thats called abraxas it is very similar to agora with a similar referred reward system thats identical to agora the market looks almost the same as far as the layout and how it works one of the things i do kinda like about it is you have to register for the markets to get a token that has to be used to be able to register on the forum this will reduce spam the bad side of this is your market account is linked to your forum account if you want to have a lookh.
thats how evolutions is also have you heard of dreammarket me know what you think.

abraham looks like it could be a good market definitely getting more popular.
abraxas needs to explain their association with agora and get rid of the javascript before they can be trusted.
quote from neofeudalist on january pmabraxas needs to explain their association with agora and get rid of the javascript before they can be trusted so register now with the link in my sig.
please do not post referred links more than once.
maybe its just a coincedence that both markets look similar it does happen although it would be a great back up plan for agora in case agra gets seized anyway have a look in pretty open that this is my invite.
i would exercise caution with this market folks for the following reasons the purchase button on all listings has been intentionally disabled right click on buy button and inspect it yourself no activity from the admins on the forums since around dec th tor browser bundle gave me a warning about the site trying to collect canvas datathis market could either be a le honeypot or a swam site hoping to collect usernames passwords and then try them on other markets youve been warned.

im going to say my original opinion of this market has changed somewhat the issues i mentioned have been sorted and i am actually surprised at how good abraxas is becoming the admin have continued to remain silent and just keep pushing updates and site improvements without any grand announcements which is weird in one way but also perfectly understandable considering the business they are in i have made a couple of small purchases and tested withdrawal it all went lawlessly if they continue to grow and dont have the downtime issues that agora has i can see abraham outranking agra very quickly time will tell.
its a nice looking market if anyone wants to check it out see my original post.

abraxas market share seems to have grown since the demise of evo and agoras down time worth having a lookif you want to have a look.
i use only verified and booked marked links i ended up with an extra in my account plus im not the only one.
today when i checked my abraham account i noticed that there was an approved withdrawal and a deposit i didnt do either of them in fact give now got more money ive noticed a couple of other posts on the abraxas forums saying the same thing has happenedanyone else.
well it could only be phishing site you visitedabraxas dun middle stole your buttcoinsvulnrability in the marketplace.
what operating system are you using sounds like you could have a virus or got wished.
im not the only one who has had weird activity posts on the abraxas forum confirm thismy links are bookmarked and i check them.
strange i have not had that problem phishing link sounds like what happened.
so someone swapped my bookmarks that ive been using since abraxas started for phishing links links that are identical to the official verified links posted on numerous sites including thehubanddeposited money in to my account.
quote from billyking on september amso someone swapped my bookmarks that ive been using since abraxas started for phishing links links that are identical to the official verified links posted on numerous sites including thehubanddeposited money in to my account in your wallet history have you checked the transaction hash associated with the strange deposit on the blockchain does the address on the blockchain match the deposit address on abraxas.

the creator of the digital currency bitcoin known only by the pseudonym satoshi nakamoto is probably an australian entrepreneur according to two new investigations wired and gizmodo have published separate stories suggesting that nakamoto s real identity is craig seven wright a year old australian described by wired as a climate change denier a aerial entrepreneur and an eccentric various attempts to prove nakamoto s identity in the past have proved unsuccessful bitcoin what you need to knowread morewired has linked wright to bitcoin by several posts on his blog starting with one published in august that mentioned his intention to release a cryptocurrency paper another published three months later asked that readers used a pip public key that has reported been linked to nakamoto a pip public key is a unique string of characters that allows a user of that encryption software to receive encrusted messages in a post dated january but later deleted wright reported announced the launch of the beta of bitcoin tomorrow wired points out that wright living on australia s east coast could have published the post after midnight his time on the night of january which would still have been before bitin s launch at pm on january in us time when the currency officially launched wright s blog was accessible on wednesday morning but was taken down completely shortly after the wired article was published wired s article notes that three of the smoking gun posts on wright s blog had been edited since publication to insert evidence of his bitcoin history the investigation is also based on a cache of leaned emails and accounting forms the article claims that wright mortgaged three properties and invested more than us m in computers power and connectivity to launch the cryptocurrency after wired contacted wright they received a response from a previously unknown email account sent from an ip address previously associated with emails sent by nakamoto but were not granted an interview more here here.
this operation is being carried out by the australian tax office ato under orders to investigate tax avoidance by his registered incorporate entities on capital gains made on the bitcoin i recall an estimate gain of m earlier this year the ato undertook a large scale incorporate tax avoidance project against mufti national mining companies for sums estimated to be in the billions to my memory no warrants were filed in obtaining hardware or information held any of the corporates information was voluntarily disclosed by the corporations who made their excuses in a senate committee some powers but not a court of law paid their bill and went on their way in my opinion the case has weak grounding from a legal perspective to have avoided tax he would have to have submitted a tax return suspicion for avoidance comes from forensic analysis of incorporate accounts and finding irregularities my feeling is that a real nakamotu is unlikely to have made as simple an error as coin laundering leading to an ato raid knock on the door that is my projection onto the myth of satoshi my other more rational feeling is that the attorney generals office is behind this brandis is been a loyal servant to his secret brethern this aligns with his other directives on data retention web filters eyes and general subservience to his incorporate and globe elite masters of war and finance this is certainly one to watch.
goes to show why having to have used an anon nym lea is going to hang whoever created btc as they did with egold even if its too late or are they expecting to find the jack pot and crash btc or cash in.
on the bright side if he does get the noble economy prize hell now be able to claim it officially.
a simple knock on the door would of been nice for this white collar criminal swat for an to operation i think there is more to this tale.
quote from nswgreat on december pma simple knock on the door would of been nice for this white collar criminal swat for an to operation i think there is more to this tale now theres a name i havent seen i a good while how you keeping hope all is well.
still thinking satoshi or the team behind btc did right after the whole farm and gold thing whom in their right mind would ever admit they created a disruptive tek wiki google that shit the whole farm market drug thing and the tetris pieces will wobble into place.
it just scam satoshi is bitin pumper now he has access for million bitcoin.

i understand your concern enigma however you have to surely take into account the vendors reputation lucy cult has an implacable record if they were a marked vendor youd have loads of people reporting issues wasnt it worth contacting the cult lucy to discuss the issue before the ban.
quote from franko on february ami placed order with lucy on wednesday sent coins and all and still no word back give message her times and give got no replay really has me worryings franko for whatever reason the last email we received from you is on the th of january cmadeline kiosk is current responding to your email we double checked all inboxes and youve no record of having sent us any email beyond that date im sure well eventually get to the bottom of that kink you or i sincerely lucymcgeei cant blame tmg for what they have decided upon weve always made it a policy to move our menu location once every so often so this is a good time to part ways anyway best of luck to tmg and all the patrons here see you guys over at the next forum again thank you and much much love note and yes we do ship quite excessively and seizures do occur once every so often since the glorious beginning we have reported seizures on our denouncer quite readily as part of our good balance duality acceptance so if youre not a recurring cultists understand who youre dealing with before you get on the hype train i truly believe that mishaps come with the territories of all great journeys not just ones pertaining to darknet shipping operations speaking from a couriers perspective if a lost package were turned in that counts as a seizure if a random package gets selected for search that counts as a seizure if someones address is flagged for reception that counts as a seizure lastly if a buyer decides to lie about the whereabouts of their package that too counts as a seizure i hope you catch my drift company mantra still remains slow down take breaks make mistakes lucy.

quote from onioncola on march ami saw a post of his here on thehub that he made somewhere yesterday thats a good sign at least when agora is up again i will check if he had logged in lets hope he is back.
i saw a post of his here on thehub that he made somewhere yesterday thats a good sign at least.
meerkovo been awhile hoping to see m back up on agora soon.
if a ever comes back up its been four day now since give been able to get onto the forum and two days since be able to get onto the market i hope meerkovo goes to another marketplace and forum like maybe kiss.
i wonder how more often ag is up using the vendor uri instead of using the normal uri edit some people are now saying vendor url is no longer in use.
in sure i read somewhere here meerkovo said he would be back on agora from sunday evening up time.
well that would indeed totally depend on ag even being up tomorrow.
spot him on nucleus.
see link below to be directed to pandoras forum with admit alice remarks on the claim by reddit.
nice to see people already correcting others about the sites function.
give invited their users here.
saying that i think i have just been banned and my thread removed yours still there doc was bound to happen sooner or later i was very polite though.
feel bad for peoples loss again its the chance we all take i guess.
quote from backopyive no role at topic you know the people behind it and their history at bmr they were and are great friends and staff members thats all i can say i wish them all the best in the world quote from backopyhere before it starts i stated that i have no role there and never had it remains the same for me i know the people who were running it from bmr they were mostly my staff but they went on their own i did not code it or ever worked there in anyway in truly sorry to know today about its seizure and im obviously concern about its admins ive no other information at the moment about if there were any arrests or know about them except for ils and shader.
as has been made common knowledge there s an issue with topic a release from is quote from pillfirepharmacy on february pmnot confirmed yet just posted by ilovespaghetti today am administrator online registered dec posts ive talked some hours with cosa and all was working good now i wake up and see this banner by the politie something doesn sound to me i will be there all the day waiting for cosa swim or jlaw to see if theres any news from them heres the actual thread discussing the issue at topic forum not assume the worst yet until there is confirmation that its in fact the police and not just a hacker demanding btc he is current manning the fort alone and trying his best to find out what is happening we know you are worried and fearing the worst but if ils has a little more spare time then fire fighting on the forum he is current doing he may be able to get some info quicker hes been there ever since he found out cut them a breather.
i think its really sad news the market just opened wonder how le located the server so other markets can take precautions and be safe most of all i hope the staff is safe and users didnt lose to much coin.
wow did this just happen.
very sorry to hear that man i know how much time and effort you guys put into it.

it was not because he was rude it was because he was an amateur programmer who was somehow gaining a lot of traction with vendors and buyers he was putting a lot of people at risk by not having the ability to back up his claims when was confronted with the truth about his massive security flaws his greed made him lie about my attacks and ignore me you should be thankful more people didnt waste their money on vendor accoutns and vendors didnt rack up sales that could be used to prosecute them.

of the messages we get from the media friends and relatives it is a miracle that you almost never hear this one few people understand that whether you run a mile or walk a mile you burn the same number of calories also walking is an activity that can be enjoyed no matter your current weight or how much you need to lose try to walk over one hour per day at least times per week if this is too difficult at the beginning walk slower and do what you can slow and steady always wins the weight loss race keep the junk out of your house i dont care how much your wife husband roommate kids love twinkies fiddle saddle moon pies there is no reason to have them they will only whine for a few days and then they will accept the facts of life that they have to get their patty sugar fix elsewhere target your difficult times and activities and alter your behavior do you have a hard time while watching television dont eat ice cream instead get used to fat free microwave popcorn its a low fat and whole grain food that is not calorie dense and gives you a lot of fiber need a sweet something after a meal try mixed fruit with watermelon and pineapple need a mid afternoon snack stock that refrigerator with apples or pears do you want to know exactly how to take the triple threat stack here you go the easiest part is the t and the sibutramine you can use those consistently same every day there is no change take one sibutramine in the morning minutes before breakfast and take of a t tablet at the same time this kills your appetite the sibutramine and revs up your metabolism the t this part of the regimen does not change except in the future varies from person to person you may want to switch to a full tablet of t you can generally tell if you are taking more t than you can handle because your back itches like crazy this is the clue to tell you to cut back on the t clenbuterol is a little tricky to take first of all because you cant just take the same dosage all the time it gets less effective and you should split it into two doses every day for the first dose you can take it in the morning with your t and sibutramine the second dose you will take about pm this assumes you work and sleep normally first shift job or like a to schedule the purpose of not taking t later in the day than or pm is so you dont have trouble sleeping some people take their last clenbuterol dose at pm though if they are very sensitive to stimulants speaking of which the dosage of the clen that you use will depend on how well you tolerate it the more you take the more weight you lose but if you find yourself getting jittery and uncomfortable nervous anxious dressed you should cut back the dosage here is a sample of clean dosages but keep in mind you might have to adjust it day mcgday monday monday monday monday day mcgday offal off that is a standard week cycle of the clen with two days off after the off days you can do a second cycle like this day mcgday monday monday monday monday day mcgday offal offall of this supposes that you are handling the side effects of and are not too bitter or anxious adjust as needed if you feel just lovely on mcg or mcg you can and many of my customers do go higher like mcg its up to you and depends on how you feel again these are divided daily doses so on your mcg days you are taking mcg in the morning with your t and sibutramine while in the afternoon you take the rest of your clenbuterol the other mcg for example if you have any other questions please let me know because i am very happy to help in any way i can i also very strongly recommend that you drink a bare minimum of gallons of water per day while you are on the triple stack if you are not drinking a ton of water your body will have trouble maintaining the proper electrolyte balance.
is that yodeling i heard or did he just say what i thought he said.
as title suggests link to sr forum and elegant thread.
oh really yikes i didnt see that but yeah i reckon its alll about defcon being er the person who started sr and him being the dev team which is why the dev team is a bit ship.
so whats this all about then boys and girls care to speculate.
quote from onionshop on october amdont know about that dox according to the guy who wrote it defcon is running half of the internet the list included every single btctumbler half of all the present darknet markets and about other sites that he was running alleged if i recall correct the hub is also listed lmfao the operation outlined would take serious staff and budget to pull off like say some alphabet agencies have maybe no way it was a one man show gon na call fed hoax ey bullshit on that omega doxx.
could it be something to do with that comprehensive dox that was posted of defcon it got taken down quickly enough but i am sure i am not the only one that got a copy of it before they pulled the pin on it wierd ship been happening since then over at sr.
dont know about that dox according to the guy who wrote it defcon is running half of the internet the list included every single btctumbler half of all the present darknet markets and about other sites that he was running alleged if i recall correct the hub is also listed.
seems theres a mass exodus from sr now that clu left.
give not been paying too much attention to sr lately so im a bit confused are you saying that defcon is that money laundering dude who ran off with the takings i was surprised that supposed one of the staff was stealing btc and was let go without having to repay anything but now im thinking that this is was deacon too the sooner someone puts a stake through the heart of that drama laden place the better it will be a mercy killing.
no one got let go from sr that was them trying to save face after clu left i think it was defcon that did it but i didnt follow it that closely i never used sr either the sr admins are scammers or know who did it and done care but theres still plenty that cant seem to figure that out lol.
just seen one user got their coin after waiting hours so seems like some serious delays down the line but getting through eventually will update if people do not receive the coin at all.
there are a few members that are experiences over hour delays in coins clearing the system they seem to get stuck on out of confirmations we have no word from vrc as yet and this is just letting people know of the current issues with this market place i will keep dated when if the solution is resolved i have invited vrc to post on the hub but so far have had no reply to the offer.

man im watching a show called fortitude which is a super creepy fun new show from sky tv that takes place in the arctic circle in a town called fortitude anyhow this woman just cut another womans stomach open with a fork and vomited clear visions liquid into her innards it sounds insane but its a really really great show its got michael gambon richard dormer stanley tucci luke broadway sophia grabol and a fantastic ensemble cast its shot in iceland but its supposed to be scabbard which is an archipelago in the arctic circle about miles north of northernmost norway that a luck lot of nor if you didnt notice its dark for a third of the year light for a third and switching for the other third rascally the temperature hovers around degrees centigrade much of the time with nights getting down below regularly the northern lights are beautiful and theres never been a crime in fortitude until now by law if you leave the town you must have a high powered rifle to protect yourself from polar bears there are polar bears on the islands and only people the ground is always frozen permafrost which means anything buried in it never decays even things like euboic plague from the s now something has been found in the ice something that could change everything this has nothing at all to do with nucleus gh reminded me of it with the comment about non melting mouth butter heres the funny thing how does a market become famous as soon as a big one collapses it kind of seems random how did nucleus become the place most people are going now for some reason this time im just not feeling the pull to follow the herd sticking with agra maybe blackbank maybe just gon na wait and see.
apparently i had been listing items of which i havent got a random message that read you are banned from this forum the ban expires at the end of the administrator or moderator that banned you left the following message remove your opium listing and i will unban you find some real drugs after about mins i was given full access again i have no idea how they came to this conclusion the only url i have put up is for the hub they seem to have gone from zero presence to insane and wrong in the space of an hour anyone else received a message like this i know of a few other that have so far.
the new mod there tried to ban an ip.
this vendor was also top notch who pulled the exit scam on buyers on pandora this is fact so be very careful people and if you have any more into please let use know.
there seems to be a lot of people having problems with this vendor with deliveries being very late is anyone having these issues also i wouldn t use this vendor till the issues has been sorted.

apparently the guy claims to be an it grad he must of been high on drugs during networking to not understand the very basics.
heres the funny thing how does a market become famous as soon as a big one collapses it kind of seems random how did nucleus become the place most people are going now for some reason this time im just not feeling the pull to follow the herd sticking with agra maybe blackbank maybe just gon na wait and see not so random as a buyer i had already given up on agora and evo felt like a giant supermarket to me but i used it anyways and would every now and then use nucleus and blackbank now that evo is gone nucleus and blackbank are my go to markets.
when did that incident happen i didn notice any problem logging in the forum other than it wouldnt load as quick as it used to before agora went down.
quote from angel eyes on march pmman im watching a show called fortitude heres the funny thing how does a market become famous as soon as a big one collapses it kind of seems random how did nucleus become the place most people are going now i have been watching fortitude as well it is a strange show with some great scenery and odd gore i think some shills have been posting claiming that nucleus has become the place most people are going now a lot during the recent troubled times to drive people to their market shooting for a self fulfilling prophecy or something maybe the strategy is working though it is off putting to those who think thats whats going on i have been avoiding it so far i dont think a e is a shill pushing that claim.
quote from godofwar on march pmhe is a known scammer back from the days of topic wow someone managed to pull a scam that quickly.
greg pmd mate quote.
no worries js not found out much info yet on them but hopefully at least this will help others if anyone sees a new heroin vendor using those pics and the listing wording please let us know as well.
really well thats odd cos of us now are waiting and why would he not reply to pms and let us leave bad feedback tis odd and its def the same guy pgp checks out.
he is a scammer for sure do not order from him.

i placed an order with him on agora on friday turned up monday i chose to fe as well so done know why i would be spared.
he is a known scammer back from the days of topic.
thanks g house its me and four other guys all ordered mon or last friday and fe i trust the boys some of us go way back so this does not look good.
quote from jacobsinger on march really well thats odd cos of us now are waiting and why would he not reply to pms and let us leave bad feedback tis odd and its def the same guy pgp checks outi thought it odd too that why i posted first time ordering from him under his current name maybe he thought in be back for more seems odd if he knew bad feedback would be coming though might as well not send it.
if you fe and leave feedback he will scam if you fe and dont leave feedback he will come through in order to maintain a healthy rate on the page.
uknextday evo banned level.
he was a guide vendor give always assumed a fair number of them are teenagers nucleus became the place to go afterwards because it was the fastest the ex mod is a joke but i think that reflects more that the admins done understand the importance of the forums than that they would have ever trusted him with anything important.
shoutout to all you idiots giving me your money mayby i did you a favour heroin is bad mkay also out of the orders you guys fed for a good of them diddnt uncropt addresses what the fuck are you that dense i should post your names and addresses here for being so idiotic use igolder encryption you lazy smackrat sorry to taint uknds name and sorry for that disabled person who diddnt get his medicine but yeahcheersthe fake uknd.
quote from knuckles on march apparently the guy claims to be an it grad he must of been high on drugs during networking to not understand the very basics the other posters have him begged as a year old which judging by his posts would seem to be the case the selection of such an individual does not exactly do a great deal for the markets street cried zaphod.

sheep used to ban people also anyone else see who nucleus market really is.
i have a vendor account on nucleus i used only briefly last year because i found the atmosphere to be kind of sketch i stuck to vending on evo because it was so much more let lol shows what i or anyone else knows when it comes to the human factor i do have to say that the admin vrc was extremely helpful in verying me despite my insistence on using a different username and was also quick to help when i lost my login due to a persistence failure vrc has seemed a bit overwhelmed and frazzled so i was surprised there were no other mods till now but his choice of an ubertard like that as a mod really cost him most of the respect i had grudgingly given him.
tell him to post here at least people will be able to see what he has contributed.

quote from herbanlegends on march amquote from godofwar on march pmsheep used to ban people also anyone else see who nucleus market really is thomas but wasnt he arrested thats not the point im trying to make sheep started a trend nobody know anyone on the markets which makes it very easy for a market owner to pull an exit scam and nobody can stop them theres no comeback look at the hub they just provide information no purchases sales etc so the hub is safe but no market is safe for a while we had dpr and then backopy and now agora but no other market that i know of is trustworthy by the time a market earns respect they are plagued by ddos attacks scammers etc someone needs to come up with a new model.
nucleus has a few obv scam vendors it seems admit dont know or dont care id avoid this mp it just looks poorly managed and thats being kind pops.
i would recommend to use fa on everything you can if possible.
in the past few days coins have vanished from a buyers account of which the pin has never been used on the admin were contracted and even though the pin has not been used thus not entered by the user ie getting phished they still are determined this is what must of happened and can not be an inside job we all know the risks and what has happened in the past with market places so this for everyone to take heed and use all possible security available this gives you the most secure means of holding your coin and can not be claimed by admin to have been wished if anyone else has had this happen to them either post here or contact myself if you do not wish to disclose your name etc.
youd have to be crazy not to deploy fa should you be a vendor at a maximum make it difficult to steal what is yours.

quote from mollymaniacs on may amis nucleus a good market to work with the uptime is good but the interface is annoying at times especially when dealing with inventory the forums over there are filled with raise garbage too and theres a lot of carding activity which is always something to be concerned with.

quote from sorrymario on march pmthe stench of bs coming from you is incredible i think we all know who the troll is turtleboyyou might possibly be the least intelligent person on the internet but thats only judging by every post you have ever made there are hundreds of threads all over the forums and reddit about people missing money idiot logic in this thread i didnt get slammed so agra definitely isn scamming the fucking admin of agora was arrested in florida on money laundering charges michelhack what is going on now is a very subtle skimming of btc while le investigates and builds their case the ignorance in this thread is unbearable no one will take the two seconds to do any real research because they dont want the truth they want to be reassured agora is a scam now please open a vein stupidmario.

i also suspect at least some of them have sent their money to a phishing site give sent withdrawn ordered etc and had hero problems with anything on agora in fact compared to sr and pandora the money shows up faster and withdraws to my personal account faster.

quote from guru on march pmi also suspect at least some of them have sent their money to a phishing site give sent withdrawn ordered etc and had hero problems with anything on agora in fact compared to sr and pandora the money shows up faster and withdraws to my personal account faster lets just pretend that you arent an agora shill with only post do you believe that because you didnt get slammed that no one was slammed do you believe that if they did scam everyone that is would be a good scam do you believe that maybe they are smart enough to not latently steal of every single customers btc do you believe that it would probably be wiser and common sense to just skim a little bit here and there if of the people dont get slammed and say everything is fine then the who do get slammed are made to look like assholes but in reality if you dont get slammed and you say well ill keep using agora because i only care about me and im not getting slammed luck everyone else then you are the asshole and a piece of shit i said if so no need to start flaming because youre butthurt.
this argument has now been separated from the originating thread.
if you ask agra market about your missing money they simply ignore you.

cool story bro.
please be advised that silk road may still be vulnerable to the heartbleed openssl exploit please go to www heartbleed com for more information about this exploit and how to protect yourself from it last exit august pm by alfred i believe this warning should be posted on the direct link so people actually see it good effort but poor execution what does everyone else think about the warning and where its posted.
quote from ghost on august pmquote from trolltergeist on august amplease be advised that silk road may still be vulnerable to the heartbleed openssl exploit please go to www heartbleed com for more information about this exploit and how to protect yourself from it last exit august pm by alfred i believe this warning should be posted on the direct link so people actually see it good effort but poor execution what does everyone else think about the warning and where its posted the main point to this whole topic is one word may do you have any substantial proof that sr is infected ever hear of political correctness that is why the word may was used alfred even put up a warning finally sr is still vulnerable sr never changed its uri like everyone else did when the news came out but hey believe and do what ya want enjoy swimming in shit idc.
you are incorrect ghost sr is vulnerable to many things defcon has done nadab in sure of that lol why hide the fact that you upgraded and secured your market that doesnt even make sense enjoy that sr poison kool aid are you on the sr shill payroll too you and chemcat in bed together with defcon and doctorclu.
quote from evilgrin on august amghost still believes in the family bullshit ideology of silk road and thinks it can be savage my issue with them not protecting against heartbleed is not the fact that they may be compromise because i dont think theyd just risk it my issue is the fact that it perpetuates ignorance they dont correct a major issue and what it does is makes the more sensible people leave and the peons who stay think its totally fine for their beloved site to not correct issues they didnt take the precautions change their url because that would slow down their noob catching which goes to show the sr admin are far more concerned with money then keeping a quality userbase think about that next time you want to say its all about the family i agree with most of what you said how about time sr said to enable js and keep trying remember that fresco sr is one huge clusterfuck avoid like the plague the family aspect of sr died when sr was seized sr is a cheap copy i got no love for off brand counterfeit bullshit or cheap fakes like sr you want a family have a kid lol you want an online community that makes ya feel good there are plenty of other forums out there on the dw try them all out and when you get one you like and is safe then you can flourish with that community sr is not friendly safe nor information i harp on the heartbleed bug cause its the most obvious and can not be disputed it is a fact no one at sr has done anything to fix it the obvious multiply thefts and cp posting on a competitors site all can be disputed though true some people would see the truth no matter what and those individuals are doomed.
ghost still believes in the family bullshit ideology of silk road and thinks it can be savage my issue with them not protecting against heartbleed is not the fact that they may be compromise because i dont think theyd just risk it my issue is the fact that it perpetuates ignorance they dont correct a major issue and what it does is makes the more sensible people leave and the peons who stay think its totally fine for their beloved site to not correct issues they didnt take the precautions change their url because that would slow down their noob catching which goes to show the sr admin are far more concerned with money then keeping a quality userbase think about that next time you want to say its all about the family.

clearnet warning warning this is a very interesting move here is the article precious metals and coin dealer image metals announced today it would stop accepting us dollars as a payment method at the end of saying it had lost confidence in the future value of the world s most popular fiat currency while several prominent retailers and dealers have joined the bitcoin ecosystem in and some businesses have always been exclusively bitin amagi is one of the first to halt fiat acceptance the company said in a statement since the dollar was coupled from gold in it has lost of its value compared to the yellow metal and of its domestic purchasing power and the trend shows no signs of stopping both investors and foreign governments have begun to lose confidence in the dollar s future and so has image metals thus image has planned that by the end of the company will no longer accept us dollars or other fiat currencies instead amagi plans to be trading exclusively in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin after amagi will serve customers holding fiat only through an exchange on its website those customers will need to convert their money into digital currency before purchasing image ceo stephen macaskill offered a grim future vision for paper currencies suggesting his decision was not as radical as it sounded with the adoption of cryptocurrencies increasing every day their viability is virtual assured history shows that paper currency backed by nothing of value will ultimately fail it s only a matter of time until no one will be accepting the dollar by trading exclusively in cryptocurrencies we ll still be in business when that time comes nearly two years of bitcoindenver colorado based image metals has been a pioneer in the bitcoin and cryptocurrency space accepting bitcoin in november when the currency had made little impact on mainstream attention bitcoin now accounts for over of all customer payments the company said and was responsible for a total m in sales up to march this year it began accepting litecoin and dogecoin payments that same month but dropped dogecoin in july along the way amagi has had to battle for its principles having bank accounts unilaterally shuttered by bank of the west bab compass and colorado s first bank for accepting bitcoin it keeps a maximum two banking partners to ensure service is never lost completely bitin and money idealsexchanging newer digital currencies into more traditional money like gold and silver added to the digital currencies stability and air of legitimacy for new investors amagi added though the two do not always walk hand in hand there is a lot of overlap between the cryptocurrency and precious metal holding communities thanks to a shared interest in sound money certain austrian economic principles and a mistrust of central bank controlled fiat currencies this has produced several businesses that trade digital currencies for precious metals and vice versa including agra commodities bullionstar and bullion bitcoin others trade precious metals via the ripple network like gold bullion international and ripple singapore while goldmoney group s netagio cold stores bitcoins alongside bullion in its vault.
i used sr and never will again yep it was my story xdsr in past made me always happy after the shit happened i tried also on sr for the first time i tried only to buy products arrived perfectly and the other were shipped after my first look to the new sr and to the new administration of the site i decided not to use it anymore and i never logged in again someone says that thehub is influencing the general bad opinion of silkroad not true every smart person understood that sr is not good time ago.
quote from yoshi on august ami just cant put my finger on it but i think your poll is missing something important ahhh thats right a smart ass comment by evilgrin i disagree with this poll and am appalled by it how bad is s silk road was a great market it was ran better than any current marketplace it was dated frequently the admins believed in peace and harmony and they never robbed their userbase its such a shame that anonymous nobodys came along to steal the silk road name for momentary gain.

i support all of the mods donating their time to the hub each and every one of them does a fantastic job there has been a lot of drama in recent days and i have type out several responses to this thread already none of which i have actually posted because i do not feel they adequately summarize my opinion on these matters but i do think it appropriate right now to say that both jackharkness and evilgrin have my deep respect and gratitude for all of the hard work they do they are both great people at their core albeit with different approaches to moderating the hub if anybody has a problem with either of them i urge you to contact me with your issues and hopefully i will be able to help you see their qualities in a different light let us all remember why we are here and let us strive to build a better community.
get rid of shifty part time mods ones who never post and only show up once every months ones who oppress us mods are not police explain that to jack harkness and ozcuntis gregory house is also useless what has go done lately ink exactly turn in your mod badge and join the masses you husk i know jack harkness and ozmandis spelling may be wrong but you know who he is ship mod have really brought down the hub as of late besides redacting true statements not a dox burying posts he doesnt want people to see and stirring up trouble what else has jh done recently he hasnt redacted any phishing site links evilgrin does that quickly jh hasnt made a funny or insightful useful post in months why is jh still a mod sucking cock well while massaging balls in not a good reason nor a requirement to be a mod and wtf has ozmandus ever done name thing in the last months that worthless trash has done positive for the hub there is nothing not even in the hidden vip area nothing so hes also useless and a detriment to the hub we need more female mods that show up work and post they seem to have a better temperament are more friendly and want to work through problems before redacting and banning unlike the male bitches that are here and semi active now i vote for dandantheicecreamman for a god job everyone likes ice cream.
